# CSA-Final-Semester1
Description:
My program is a CYOA (ChooseYourOWnAdventure) where you play the role of an adult who is staying at their grandfathers abandoned barn house. Where the objective is to survive the night at his house without being killed by the killer.

How to play:
 My game is based on user returns of 1’s and 2’s which are options as to what they want to do in certain situations.
 
 Interesting feature:
 
 you can beat the game in 4 moves
